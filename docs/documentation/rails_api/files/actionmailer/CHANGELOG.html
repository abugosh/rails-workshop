</p>
<ul>
<li>subject is automatically looked up on <a
href="../../classes/I18n.html">I18n</a> using mailer_name and action_name
as scope as in t(&#8220;.subject&#8221;) [JK]

</li>
<li>Changed encoding behaviour of mail, so updated tests in actionmailer and
bumped mail version to 2.2.1 [ML]

</li>
<li>Added ability to pass Proc objects to the defaults hash [ML]

</li>
<li>Removed all quoting.rb type files from ActionMailer and put Mail 2.2.0 in
instead [ML]

</li>
<li>Lot of updates to various test cases that now work better with the new Mail
and so have different expectations

</li>
<li>Added interceptors and observers from Mail [ML]

<pre>
  ActionMailer::Base.register_interceptor calls Mail.register_interceptor
  ActionMailer::Base.register_observer calls Mail.register_observer
</pre>
</li>
<li>Mail::Part now no longer has nil as a default charset, it is always set to
something, and defaults to UTF-8

</li>
<li>Added explict setting of charset in set_fields! method to make sure Mail
has the user defined default

</li>
<li>Removed quoting.rb and refactored for Mail to take responsibility of all
quoting and auto encoding requirements for the header.

</li>
<li>Fixed several tests which had incorrect encoding.

</li>
<li>Changed all utf-8 to UTF-8 for consistency

</li>
<li>Whole new API added with tests. See base.rb for full details. Old API is
deprecated.

</li>
<li>The Mail::Message class has helped methods for all the field types that
return &#8216;common&#8217; defaults for the common use case, so to get the
subject, mail.subject will give you a string, mail.date will give you a <a
href="../../classes/DateTime.html">DateTime</a> object, mail.from will give
you an array of address specs (mikel@test.lindsaar.net) etc. If you want to
access the field object itself, call mail[:field_name] which will return
the field object you want, which you can then chain, like
mail[:from].formatted

</li>
<li>Mail#content_type now returns the content_type field as a string. If you
want the mime type of a mail, then you call Mail#mime_type (eg,
text/plain), if you want the parameters of the content type field, you call
Mail#content_type_parameters which gives you a hash, eg
{&#8216;format&#8217; => &#8216;flowed&#8217;, &#8216;charset&#8217; =>
&#8216;utf-8&#8217;}

</li>
<li><a href="../../classes/ActionMailer/Base.html">ActionMailer::Base</a>
:default_implicit_parts_order now is in the sequence of the order you want,
no reversing of ordering takes place. The default order now is text/plain,
then text/enriched, then text/html and then any other part that is not one
of these three.

</li>
<li>Mail does not have &#8220;quoted_body&#8220;, &#8220;quoted_subject&#8220;
etc. All of these are accessed via body.encoded, subject.encoded etc

</li>
<li>Every object in a Mail object returns an object, never a string. So
Mail.body returns a Mail::Body class object, need to call encoded or
decoded to get the string you want.

</li>
<li>Mail::Message#set_content_type does not exist, it is simply
Mail::Message#content_type

</li>
<li>Every mail message gets a unique message_id unless you specify one, had to
change all the tests that check for equality with expected.encoded ==
actual.encoded to first replace their message_ids with control values

</li>
<li>Mail now has a proper concept of parts, remove the ActionMailer::Part and
ActionMailer::PartContainer classes

</li>
<li>Calling encoded on any object returns it as a string ready to go into the
output stream of an email, this means it includes the r\n at the end of the
lines and the object is pre-wrapped with r\n\t if it is a header field.
Also, the &#8220;encoded&#8221; value includes the field name if it is a
header field.

</li>
<li>Attachments are only the actual attachment, with filename etc. A part
contains an attachment. The part has the content_type etc. So
attachments.last.content_type is invalid. But parts.last.content_type

</li>
<li>There is no idea of a &#8220;sub_head&#8220; in Mail. A part is just a
Message with some extra functionality, so it just has a
&#8220;header&#8221; like a normal mail message

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*2.3.2 [Final] (March 15, 2009)*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that ActionMailer should send correctly formatted Return-Path in MAIL
FROM for SMTP 1842 [Matt Jones]

</li>
<li>Fixed RFC-2045 quoted-printable bug 1421 [squadette]

the SMTP server supports it (This is required for Gmail&#8217;s SMTP
server) 1336 [Grant Hollingworth]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*2.2.0 [RC1] (October 24th, 2008)*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add layout functionality to mailers [Pratik Naik]

<p>

need to have &#8216;_mailer&#8217; postfix for them to be automatically
picked up.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*2.1.0 (May 31st, 2008)*
</p>

</li>
<li>Updated TMail to version 1.2.1 [Mikel Lindsaar]

<li>Added access to custom headers, like cc, bcc, and reply-to 268 [Andreas
Schwarz]. Example:

<pre>
  def post_notification(recipients, post)
    @recipients          = recipients
    @from                = post.author.email_address_with_name
    @headers[&quot;bcc&quot;]      = SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR_EMAIL
    @headers[&quot;reply-to&quot;] = &quot;notifications@example.com&quot;
    @subject             = &quot;[#{post.account.name} #{post.title}]&quot;
    @body[&quot;post&quot;]        = post
  end
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Consolidated the server configuration options into Base#server_settings=
and expanded that with controls for authentication and more [Marten] NOTE:
This is an API change that could potentially break your application if you
used the old application form. Please do change!

</li>
<li>Added Base#deliveries as an accessor for an array of emails sent out
through that ActionMailer class when using the :test delivery option.
[Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added Base#perform_deliveries= which can be set to false to turn off the
actual delivery of the email through smtp or sendmail. This is especially
useful for functional testing that shouldn&#8217;t send off real emails,
but still trigger delivery_* methods.

</li>
<li>Added option to specify delivery method with Base#delivery_method=. Default
is :smtp and :sendmail is currently the only other option. Sendmail is
assumed to be present at &#8220;/usr/sbin/sendmail&#8220; if that option is
used. [Kent Sibilev]

</li>
<li>Dropped &#8220;include TMail&#8221; as it added to much baggage into the
default namespace (like Version) [Chad Fowler]

</li>
</ul>
