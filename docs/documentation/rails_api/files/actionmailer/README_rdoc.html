        <h1>Action Mailer &#8212; Easy email delivery and testing</h1>
<p>
Action Mailer is a framework for designing email-service layers. These
layers are used to consolidate code for sending out forgotten passwords,
welcome wishes on signup, invoices for billing, and any other use case that
requires a written notification to either a person or another system.
</p>
<p>
Action Mailer is in essence a wrapper around Action Controller and the Mail
gem. It provides a way to make emails using templates in the same way that
Action Controller renders views using templates.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, an Action Mailer class can be used to process incoming email,
such as allowing a weblog to accept new posts from an email (which could
even have been sent from a phone).
</p>
<h2>Sending emails</h2>
<p>
The framework works by initializing any instance variables you want to be
available in the email template, followed by a call to <tt>mail</tt> to
deliver the email.
</p>
<p>
This can be as simple as:
</p>
<pre>
  class Notifier &lt; ActionMailer::Base
    delivers_from 'system@loudthinking.com'

    def welcome(recipient)
      @recipient = recipient
      mail(:to =&gt; recipient,
           :subject =&gt; &quot;[Signed up] Welcome #{recipient}&quot;)
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
The body of the email is created by using an Action View template (regular
ERb) that has the instance variables that are declared in the mailer
action.
</p>
<p>
So the corresponding body template for the method above could look like
this:
</p>
<pre>
  Hello there,

  Mr. &lt;%= @recipient %&gt;

  Thank you for signing up!
</pre>
<p>
And if the recipient was given as &#8220;david@loudthinking.com&#8220;, the
email generated would look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  Date: Mon, 25 Jan 2010 22:48:09 +1100
  From: system@loudthinking.com
  To: david@loudthinking.com
  Message-ID: &lt;4b5d84f9dd6a5_7380800b81ac29578@void.loudthinking.com.mail&gt;
  Subject: [Signed up] Welcome david@loudthinking.com
  Mime-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: text/plain;
        charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;;
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

  Hello there,

  Mr. david@loudthinking.com
</pre>
<p>
In previous version of rails you would call <tt>create_method_name</tt> and
<tt>deliver_method_name</tt>. <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
3.0 has a much simpler interface, you simply call the method and optionally
call <tt>deliver</tt> on the return value.
</p>
<p>
Calling the method returns a Mail Message object:
</p>
<pre>
  message = Notifier.welcome  # =&gt; Returns a Mail::Message object
  message.deliver             # =&gt; delivers the email
</pre>
<p>
Or you can just chain the methods together like:
</p>
<pre>
  Notifier.welcome.deliver    # Creates the email and sends it immediately
</pre>
<h2>Receiving emails</h2>
<p>
To receive emails, you need to implement a public instance method called
<tt>receive</tt> that takes a tmail object as its single parameter. The
Action Mailer framework has a corresponding class method, which is also
called <tt>receive</tt>, that accepts a raw, unprocessed email as a string,
which it then turns into the tmail object and calls the receive instance
method.
</p>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
  class Mailman &lt; ActionMailer::Base
    def receive(email)
      page = Page.find_by_address(email.to.first)
      page.emails.create(
        :subject =&gt; email.subject, :body =&gt; email.body
      )

      if email.has_attachments?
        for attachment in email.attachments
          page.attachments.create({
            :file =&gt; attachment, :description =&gt; email.subject
          })
        end
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
This Mailman can be the target for Postfix or other MTAs. In <a
href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, you would use the runner in the
trivial case like this:
</p>
<pre>
  rails runner 'Mailman.receive(STDIN.read)'
</pre>
<p>
However, invoking <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> in the
runner for each mail to be received is very resource intensive. A single
instance of <a href="../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> should be run
within a daemon if it is going to be utilized to process more than just a
limited number of email.
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
The Base class has the full list of configuration options. Here&#8217;s an
example:
</p>
<pre>
  ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
    :address        =&gt; 'smtp.yourserver.com', # default: localhost
    :port           =&gt; '25',                  # default: 25
    :user_name      =&gt; 'user',
    :password       =&gt; 'pass',
    :authentication =&gt; :plain                 # :plain, :login or :cram_md5
  }
</pre>
